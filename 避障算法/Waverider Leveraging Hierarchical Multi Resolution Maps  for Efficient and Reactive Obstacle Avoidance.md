# Waverider: Leveraging Hierarchical, Multi-Resolution Maps  for Efficient and Reactive Obstacle Avoidance
反应式的精准避障方法
Existing approaches range from simple reactive methods using 1D distance sensors to optimization-based systems requiring complete 3D maps and vary in complexity, reaction time, and obstacle resolution

One way to introduce memory without losing generality is to use volumetric maps.
